Of course, if one is attempting to dominate the European call rather than replicate it, then one can use the trivial strategy of buying one share of the underlying stock and holding to maturity. In this paper we prove that this is, in fact, the least expensive method of dominating a European call in a Black-Scholes model with proportional transaction costs.},

Using this principle, a theoretical valuation formula for options is derived. Since almost all corporate liabilities can be viewed as combinations of options, the formula and the analysis that led to it are also applicable to corporate liabilities such as common stock, corporate bonds, and warrants. In particular, the formula can be used to derive the discount that should be applied to a corporate bond because of the possibility of default.},

This is possible, without further assumptions, only if the project returns can be duplicated (or bounded) by a deterministic intertemporal program of purchasing a portfolio of marketed assets. These results are proven and used to simplify and unify a number of topics in financial economics, including project valuation, Modigliani-Miller theory, forward pricing, the closed-end mutual fund paradox, and efficient market theories.},
