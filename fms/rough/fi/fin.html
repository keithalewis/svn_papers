<p>
The <em>short rate process</em> \((r_t)_{t\ge0}\) represents a series
of instruments that cost 1 unit at time \(t\) and pay \(1 + r_t\,dt =
\exp(r_t\,dt)\) at time \(t + dt\).  The <em>stochastic discount</em> is
defined to be
\[
D_t = e^{-\int_0^t r_s\,ds}.
\]
If \((X_t)_{t\ge0}\) is
the price of an instrument that pays no cash flows, then the fundamental
theorem of asset pricing implies \((X_tD_t)_{t\ge0}\) is a martingale.
Note that one unit invested at time 0 and rolled over at the short rate
grows to \(1/D_t\) at time t. Clearly \((1/D_t) D_t = 1\) is a martingale.

</p>
<p>
Let \(D(t,u)\) be the price at time \(t\) of a <em>zero coupon bond</em>
that pays 1 unit at time \(u\). Since \(t\mapsto D(t,u)D_t\) is a
martingale we have \(D(t, u)D_t = E_t D(u,u)D_u = E_t D_u\) so
\[
D(t, u) = \frac{E_t D_u}{D_t}.
\]
A forward starting zero coupon bond starting at \(u\)
and terminating at \(v\) represents a zero cost contract at time \(t\)
to pay \(D(t;u,v)\) at time \(u\) and receive a payment of 1 unit
at time \(v\). This is equivalent to being short \(D(t;u,v)\) a zero
coupon bond maturing at \(u\) and being long a zero coupon bond maturing
at \(v\), hence \(0 = -D(t;u,v)D(t,u) + D(t,v)\) and so \(D(t;u,v)
= D(t,v)/D(t,u)\).

</p>
<p>
A <em>forward rate agreement</em> is a zero cost contract at time \(t\)
over the interval \([u,v]\) to pay 1 unit at time \(u\) and receive \(1 +
F_\delta(t;u,v)\delta(u,v)\) at time \(v\), where \(\delta(u,v)\) is the
<em>day count fraction</em> (approximately equal to \(v - u\) in years)
for the interval. Scaling the payoffs by dividing by \(1 +
F_\delta(t;u,v)\delta(u,v)\) is equivalent to a forward starting
zero coupon bond so we have \(D(t;u,v) = 1/(1 + F\delta)\) hence
\[
F_\delta(t;u,v) = \frac{1}{\delta(u,v)}(\frak{D(t,u)}{D(t,v)} - 1)
\]
