<h1>
Mortgage-Backed Securities
</h1>
<p>
Mortgage-backed securities are instruments backed by pools of
residential or commercial mortgages. Banks and other mortgage
originators sell the loans to governmental or private entities
that resell pro-rata share of all principal and interest
payments on the mortgages.
There are also more complicated structures such as collateralized
mortgage obligations that issue tranches of the cash flows that
have varying risk characteristics.
</p>
<p>
The primary risk for MBS investors comes from prepayments. When
interest rates fall, borrowers tend to pay off their mortgage
and the principal is returned in a less attractive reinvestment
environment. For unsecured mortgages there is also a significant
credit risk due to default.
