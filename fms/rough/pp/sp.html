<title>Stochastic Processes</title>

<h1>Stochastic Processes</h1>
<p>
A <em>stochastic process</em> is a collection of random variables
and algebras indexed by time, \((X_t)_{t\in T}\) and
\(({\cal A}_t)_{t\in T}\), where \(T\subseteq [0,\infty)\).
Just as a random variables are determined by their joint distribution, 
a <em>stochastic process</em> is completely
determined by its finite joint distributions. Given \(t_0\lt\cdots\lt t_n\) in \(T\) the
corresponding finite joint distribution is \(F(x_0,\dots,x_n) = P(X_{t_0}\le x_0,\dots,X_{t_n}\le x_n)\).
</p>
<p>
A random process is <em>adapted</em> if \(X_t\) is \({\cal A}_t\) measurable for every \(t\in T\). If
we consider \({\cal A}_t\) to be the partial information available at time \(t\) then this means the
process does not 'look into the future.'
</p>
<p>
Typically the algebras have the property \({\cal A}_t\subseteq{\cal A}_u\) if \(t\lt u\) to reflect the
notion that information increases over time. We do not make that assumption in general to
reflect that under some conditions the only information required at time \(t\) is
the currently information and that the historical information is not required. This
is often the case with Markov processes or binomial tree models.
</p>
<h2>Martingales</h2>
<p>
A <em>martingale</em> is a stochastic process with the property
\(E[X_u|{\cal A}_t] = X_t\) for \(t\lt u\). 
Processes having independent increments are martingales.  A simple way
to produce martingales is to fix a random variable \(X\) and define
\(X_t = E[X|{\cal A}_t]\). This is a martingale by the tower property
of conditional expectation, but not all martingales can be expressed
this way.

</p>

<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p>
The Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing states arbitrage free models
of prices have a positive scalar muliplier (<em>price deflator</em>)
making them into martingales.

</p>
<p>
Futures quotes are naturally occuring martingales because the price of
a futures contract is always zero.

</p>
<p>
There is a deep connection between martingales and harmonic functions
as first shown by <a href="./papers/Kakutani1944.pdf">Kakutani</a>
in 1944 for the case of 2-dimensional Brownian motion.
