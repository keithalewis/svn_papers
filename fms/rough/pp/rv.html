<title>Random Variables</title>

<h1>Random Variables</h1>
<p>
The modern definition of a <em>random variable</em> is that it is a
function from a probability space to the real numbers.

</p>
<p>
It will probably be no surprise this was not the first definition of a
random variable.  In its early stages, probability theory was considered
a disreputable branch of mathematics useful only for wagering on games of
chance. It wasn't until the 1930's when it was placed on mathematically
sound measure theoretic standings by Kolomogorov and others that it
became a respectable branch of mathematics. We've seem to have come full
circle now.

</p>
<p>
The first definition was more closely related to cumulative distribution
functions.  A random variable is like the variable we all learned in high
school algebra.  It is a placeholder for a number in equations, but with
additional information about the probability of what values it can take.

</p>
<p>
The <em>expected value</em> of the random variable \(X\)
that takes on only a finite number of values \(\{x_i\}\) is

\[
E[X] = \sum_i x_i\,P(X = x_i) = \sum_i x_i\,P(X^{-1}(\{x_i\})).
\]
More generally, if \(f\) is a real-valued function we can define
\[
E[f(X)] = \sum_i f(x_i)\,P(X = x_i).
\]
If you know something about measure theory and
Riemann-Stieltjes integration, you
can show \(\int_\Omega f\,dP = \int_\R f(x)\,dF(x)\) where
\(F\) is the cdf of \(X\).
