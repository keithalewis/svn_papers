<h1>Cumulative Distribution Functions</h1>
<p>
Every random variable is completely deterimined by its <em>cumulative
distribution function</em>.  A cdf is a function \(F:\R\to[0,1]\) that
is non-decreasing, right continuous, \(\lim_{x\to-\infty}F(x) = 0\),
and \(\lim_{x\to\infty}F(x) = 1\).  If \(X\) is a random variable then
\(F_X(x) = P(X\le x) = P(\{\omega\in\Omega\colon X(\omega)\le x\})\)
is a cdf.  Two random variables having the same cdf are said to have
the same <em>law</em> since they are statistically indistinguishable.

<span class="ex">Exercise.</span>
<span class="it">
Let \(X\) be a random variable and define \(F(x) = P(X\le x)\). If \(P\) is
countably additive show \(F\) is a cdf.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="ex">Exercise.</span>
<span class="it">
Let \(F\) be a cdf, define \(X\colon\R\to\R\) by \(X(x) = x\) and the
probabity measure \(P\) by
\(P((-\infty,x]) = \int_{-\infty}^x dF(x)\). Show \(F\) is the cdf of \(X\).
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="ex">Exercise.</span>
<span class="it">
Let \(F\) be a cdf and let \(U\) be uniformly distribute on \([0,1]\). Define
\(X = F^{-1}(U)\). Show \(F\) is the cdf of \(X\).
</span>
</p>
<p>
The last exercise shows that the randomness of any random variable is
contained in a uniformly distributed random variable. BTW, there is no
such thing as a random random variable.

</p>
<span class="ex">Exercise.</span>
<span class="it">
If \(X\) has cdf \(F\) show \(F(X)\) is uniformly distributed on \([0,1]\).

<p>
Not every random variable can be defined by a <em>probability density
function</em>, i.e., it is not always the case the cdf \(F(x) =
\int_{-\infty}^x f(u)\,du\) for some integrable function \(f\). If so,
\(f\) is the pdf. It can be shown the cdf comes from a pdf if and only
if \(dF\) is absolutely continuous (\(\int_E dF = 0\) if \(m(E) = 0\)
where \(m\) is Lesbegue measure).
