<h1>Independence</h1>
<p>
Two algebras, \({\cal A}\) and \({\cal B}\), are <em>independent</em> under the probability
measure \(P\) if \(P(A\cap B) = P(A) P(B)\) for every \(A\in{\cal A}\) and \(B\in{\cal B}\). 
A random variable \(X\) is <em>independent</em> of an algebra \({\cal A}\) if the smallest 
algebra making \(X\) measurable is independent of \({\cal A}\). 
Two random variables are <em>independent</em> if the smallest algebras under which they 
are measurable are independent.
</p>
<p>
One nice feature of independent random variables is that their marginal distributions
determine their joint distribution. If \(X\) has cdf \(F\) and \(Y\) has cdf \(G\)
then their joint distribution is \(H(x,y) = P(X\le x,Y\le y) = F(x)G(y)\).
</p>
<h2>Copulas</h2>
<p>
Maybe this section should be titled Dependence. Copulas contain precisely the information
required to connect marginal distributions into joint distributions. With notation
as above, the <em>copula</em> of \(X\) and \(Y\) is the joint distribution of
\(F(X)\) and \(G(Y)\), \(C(u, v) = P(F(X)\le u, G(Y)\le v)\), \(0\le u,v\le 1\). 
Recall both of these random variables are uniformly distributed on \([0,1]\).
