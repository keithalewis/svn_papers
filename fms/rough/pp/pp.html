<h1>Poisson Process</h1>
<blockquote>
<em>We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that
is in it and stop there, lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hot
stove-lid. She will never sit down on a hot stove-lid again, and that
is well; but also she will never sit down on a cold one anymore.</em>
- Mark Twain

<p>
A <em>Poisson process</em> counts things that have a probability of
occuring that is proportional to the time you have to wait for them. They
are characterized by one parameter, \(\lambda\). If \((N_t)\) is a Poisson
process with parameter \(\lambda\), then \(P(N_{t + \Delta t} - N_t = 0)
= 1 - \lambda\Delta t + o(\Delta t)\) and \(P(N_{t + \Delta t} - N_t =
1) = \lambda\Delta t + o(\Delta t)\). This implies Poisson processes
don't jump twice at the same time; they do not have a memory, unlike
Mark Twain's cat.
