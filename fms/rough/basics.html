<h1>Basic Facts about Futures</h1>
<p>
A <em>futures</em> contract is specified by an underlying index and
an expiration date. Prior to the the expiration the price is whatever
the market says it is.
</p>
<p>
The actual mechanics of trading a futures contract is that it costs
nothing to enter into the contract, modulo setting up an account
with a broker and providing an initial margin. You get paid the
change in the market quoted price each day until your margin is
used up. Then your broker will take you out of your position, usually
at a price unfavorable to you.
</p>
<p>
The mathematical idealization of this is that the quoted price of a futures
is a martingale.
</p>
<p>
Let \(F\) be the value of the futures at expiration having cumulative
distribution function \(\Phi(x) = P(F\le x)\).
and \(f = E F\).
We assume \(F\ge0\).
\(p(k) = E(k -F)^+\), \(c(k) = E(F - k)^+\), \(p(0) = 0\), \(c(0) = EF\).
\(p(0) = 0\), \(c(k) - (f - k)\to 0\) as \(k\to\infty\).
\(p(k) - c(k) = k - EF\), \(p'(k) - c'(k) = 1\).
\(p'(k) = P(F\le k) = \Phi(k)\), \(c'(k) = -P(F\ge k) = \Phi(k) - 1\).
\(p'(0) = 0\), \(c'(0) = 1\).
\(p'(k) \ge 0\),
\(c'(k) \le 0\),
\(p''(k) = c''(k) = \Phi'(k) \ge 0\).
</p>
<p>
\(E(F - a)^2 = 2\int_0^a p(k)\,dk + 2\int_a^\infty c(k)\,dk\).
