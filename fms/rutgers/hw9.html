<p>
Your job is to provide a convincing argument that what you claim
is correct.
</p>

<p>
<span class="ex">Exercise 1.</span>
<span class="it">
Find the credit spread of a one year zero coupon bond
assuming a risk free rate of 1%, a default intensity of 5%, and 50% recovery.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="ex">Exercise 2.</span>
<span class="it">
Consider an option on a risky 1 year zero coupon bond having $100 notional
that pays $1 if the bond is trading between $10 and $90 one day prior
to expiration. Assuming the risk free rate is 1%, the default intensity
is 5%, and recovery is zero, what is the value of this option rounded
to the nearest penny.

<p>
The Plackett family of copulas are given by
\[
C_\theta(u,v) =
\frac{1 + (\theta - 1)(u + v)
- \sqrt{[1 + (\theta - 1)(u + v)]^2 - 4uv\theta(\theta - 1)}}
{2(\theta - 1)}
\]
for \(\theta\ge0\) and \(C_1(u,v) = uv\). Note that
\(C_0(u, v) = \max\{u + v - 1, 0\}\) and
\(C_\infty(u, v) = \min\{u, v\}\) give the bookends of
the Frech\'et-Hoeffding inequality.
</p>
<p>
Given two random variables \(X\) and \(Y\) the <em>odds ratio</em>
is \(\theta(x,y) = P(X>x,Y>y)P(X\le x,Y\le y)/P(X>x,Y\le y)P(X\le x,Y>y)\).
Note that if \(X\) and \(Y\) are independent, then \(\theta = 1\),
if \(Y = X\) then \(\theta = \infty\), and if \(Y = -X\) then
\(\theta = 0\) for all \(x\), \(y\).
</p>
<p>
<span class="ex">Exercise 3.</span>
<span class="it">
If \(U\) and \(V\) are two random variables uniformly distributed
on the unit interval having a Plackett joint distribution, show
the odds ratio \(\theta(u,v)\) is constant.
</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="ex">Exercise 4.</span>
<span class="it">
Consider a one year floating leg of a risky swap no recovery and payment
frequency \(f\) times per year. Let \(V(f) = \sum_{j=1}^f (D(0,(j-1)/f) -
D(0,j/f))P(T > j/f)\). Show \(V(2) \ge V(1)\).

</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="ex">Extra Credit (25 points).</span>
<span class="it">
Show \(V(f)\) in exercise 4 is an increasing function of \(f\).
