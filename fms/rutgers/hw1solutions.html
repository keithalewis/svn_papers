Math 628 Sp12 Homework 1
</h1>

<p>
Your job is to provide a convincing argument that what you claim
is correct.
</p>

<p>
<span class="ex">Exercise 1.</span>
<span class="it">
Consider the two period deterministic model having three instruments
\(D_{01}\), \(D_{02}\), and \(D_{012}\); a zero coupon bond maturing
at \(t_1\), a zero coupon bond maturing at \(t_2\), and a forward
starting zero coupon bond from \(t_1\) to \(t_2\).
The non zero cash flows for the bonds are \(C_1(D_{01}) = 1\),
\(C_2(D_{02}) = 1\), \(C_1(D_{012}) = -D_{012}\), and \(C_2(D_{012}) = 1\).
Given prices \(X_0(D_{01}) = D_{01}\), \(X_0(D_{02}) = D_{02}\), and
\(X_0(D_{012}) = 0\), find the the value of \(D_{012}\) in terms
of \(D_{01}\) and \(D_{02}\) that ensures
the model is arbitrage free.
</span>
(Hint: Find the unique price deflators \(\Pi_0 = 1\), \(\Pi_1\) and \(\Pi_2\).)
</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>
By the FTAP \(D_{01} = 1\Pi_1\), \(D_{02} = 1 \Pi_2\) and \(0 = -D_{012}\Pi_1
+ 1 \Pi_2\) so \(D_{012} = \Pi_2/\Pi_1 = D_{02}/D_{01}\).
</p>

<p>
<span class="ex">Exercise 2.</span>
<span class="it">
Consider the n period model having instruments \(R_j\), \(0\le j\lt n\)
where \(X_j(R_j) = 1\), \(X_{j+1}(R_j) = 0\)
and \(C_{j+1}(R_j) = R_j\) and is zero otherwise. 
Assuming \(R_j\) is measurable with respect
to the algebra corresponding to time \(t_j\) and \(\Pi_j\) is
predictable, i.e., \(\Pi_j\) is measurable with respect to the algebra
corresponding to time \(t_{j-1}\).
Find a formula for the
price deflators \(\Pi_j\) and use that to determine the cash flow,
\(-D_{ijk}\), at time
\(t_j\) for a forward starting zero coupon bond over the interval \(t_j\)
to \(t_k\), \(i\le j\lt k\) in terms of the price at time \(t_i\) of
zero coupon bonds maturing at times \(t_j\) and \(t_k\).
</span>
(Hint: The price of the forward starting zero coupon bond is 0 at time
\(t_i\) and has non-zero cash flows \(-D_{ijk}\) at time \(t_j\)
and 1 at time \(t_k\).)
</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>
By the FTAP \(1 \Pi_j = E_{j} R_{j} \Pi_{j+1} = R_{j} \Pi_{j+1}\)
since \((\Pi_j)\) is predictable, hence \(\Pi_j = 1/R_0\cdots R_{j-1}\).
Also \(D_{ij}\Pi_i = E_i 1 \Pi_j\) so \(D_{ij} = E_i \Pi_j/\Pi_i\).
Again using the FTAP, \(0 = E_i -D_{ijk} \Pi_j + 1 \Pi_k\) so
\(D_{ijk} = E_i \Pi_k/\Pi_j = D_{ik}/D_{ij}\).

</p>
<p>
<span class="ex">Exercise 3.</span>
<span class="it">
Using the same model as in exercise 2, find the quote, \(F_{ijk}\),
at time \(t_i\)
of a forward rate agreement over the interval \([t_j, t_k]\) having
day count fraction \(\delta_{jk}\) in terms of \(D(t, u) = E_t[\Pi_u]/\Pi_t\),
the price at time \(t\) of a zero coupon bond maturing at \(u\).
The price of the FRA is zero at \(t_i\) and has cash flows of \(-1\)
at time \(t_j\) and \(1 + F_{ijk}\delta_{jk}\) at time \(t_k\).
</span>
</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>
We have \(0 = E_i -1\Pi_j + (1 + F_{ijk}\delta_{jk})\Pi_k\) so
\(F_{ijk} = E_i (\Pi_j/\Pi_k - 1)/\delta_{jk}
= (D_{ij}/D_{ik} - 1)/\delta_{jk}\).
</p>

<span class="ex">Exercise 4.</span>
<span class="it">
Using the notation in exercise 3, show that in an arbitrage free model
that receiving the cash flows \(F_{j,j,j+1}\delta_{j,j+1}\) at time \(t_{j+1}\)
for \(0\le j\lt n\) has the same value as receiving \(1\)
at \(t_0\) and paying \(1\) at time \(t_n\).
</span>
</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>
We have 
\(
E\sum_{0\le j\lt n} F_{j,j,j+1}\delta_{j,j+1} \Pi_{j+1}
= E\sum_{0\le j\lt n} (E_j \Pi_j/\Pi_{j+1} - 1) \Pi_{j+1}
= E\sum_{0\le j\lt n} (\Pi_j - \Pi_{j+1})
= 1 - E\Pi_n\).
