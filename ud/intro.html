This slim pamphlette describes a unified approach to pricing, hedging,
and evaluating the risk of derivative securities.  There is only one
model for a derivative securitie, a vector-valued stochastic process. It
is simply a matter of how you parameterize it. The goal of this
book is to make that claim obvious to you.

Before diving into the mathematics it is important to have some
picture of the who, what, when and where of the financial world.
The first chapter describes the various market participants,
the types of instruments involved, and the mechanics of transactions.
Fischer Black was a fan of defining vocabulary and so am I. First
and foremost a quant needs to be able to communicate effectively
with the business people he or she interacts with.

Chapter 2 introduces the one-period model and the Fundamental Theorem
of Asset Pricing in that context. Arbitrage is always defined relative
to a model and arbitrage free models have constraints on the dynamics of
prices, as Black and Scholes showed in 1973. The theorem is then used to
prove basic facts such as the cost-of-carry formula. One unique feature of
our approach is that it can be used to find an arbitrage if one exists.

In chapter 3 the multi-period model is defined and the FTAP for it is
proved using relatively elementary mathematics. By using finitely additive
measures instead of countably additive the application of the Hanh-Banach
theorem, as first used by Stephen Ross in 1978, is greatly simplified.
The model is used to understand exactly how forwards and futures differ
and to indicate the pivotal role of the short rate process in fixed
income derivatives.

Continuous time models are discussed in chapter 4 and the classical
Black-Scholes/Merton model is rigourously deduced. L\'evy models
are introduced and...

The only way to really learn mathematical finance is to implement models
using software. No business person has ever paid me to write a paper. They
want something they can use to make decisions. We will use C++ and Excel
since they are the most common tools used by quants and traders.
